      "page_content='32 Tomatoes... It’s difficult to imagine a complete garden without them. And in the kitchen, they’re a favorite--a rich, versatile vegetable that is equally at home in nutritious salad or on a satisfying burger. And yet when you’re growing them, tomatoes can often be problematic. Their culinary versatility also translate into their growing habits as well, as they show a willingness to grow however they please, seeming to defy both gravity and the nearness of your garden plot. Biologically, your tomato plants want to mature and spread their seeds, dropping the tomatoes to the earth, so gardeners often seek out ways to elevate their tomatoes. Other reasons to support your tomatoes include: • Your tomatoes are less prone to insect and disease damage. If you choose to support your tomatoes, then you’ve got another problem: What option to do you choose? Do you follow in the footsteps of your grandfather and create a cage for your tomatoes? Do you stake them? • Your tomatoes stay dirt-free. • Your tomatoes are easier to monitor and harvest. the florida weave' metadata={'page': 32, 'source': './docs/Technical-Gardening-Manual-FINAL.pdf'}\n",
      "page_content='3 Gardening is easy, right? All you do is measure some rows, till the earth, and plant your seeds. From there, your garden will grow on its while you sit back and relax... Right? Wrong. Like all worthwhile pursuits, gardening requires devotion and routine maintenance. Your heirloom tomatoes can indeed blossom from A all the way to Z, but they will need your help getting there, as you water and perhaps trellis them along their path to ripeness. Yes, the seeds you’ve sown today will need attention tomorrow.... And the tomorrow after that, all the way to harvest time. And before we can consider tomorrow’s work, we have to consider yesterday’s. PLANTING CONSIDERATIONS PREVENTATIVE MEASURES Often, the best way to solve a problem is by ensuring that it never happens. Of course, an incredible cook can salvage a cooking fiasco without the perfect ingredients or tools, but just imagine how much tastier the dish would be if all the right pieces had been in the kitchen all along. The same applies to gardening, where the earth is your kitchen. Here’s what you can do in the early stages of gardening to ensure that you don’t end up with a fiasco months down the road.' metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './docs/Technical-Gardening-Manual-FINAL.pdf'}\n",
      "page_content='33 While none of your options are necessarily bad and everything has its place, based on the particulars of your operation, we at Grow Appalachia recommend the Florida Weave method of tomato trellising. This method appeals to growers because it’s inexpensive and it works. HOW IT WORKS One thing that you need to keep in mind is that you want to do the trellising process pretty early on, before your plants are more than a couple of feet tall. If you try the Florida Weave method later than this, you run the risk of stalking your roots and traumatizing your plants, and it will be difficult to work around the tangled vegetation. You’ll begin by taking stakes around 8 feet tall and driving them a foot into the ground between every few plants. Next, you will want to take some twine, preferably something that’s not too elastic, and tie it to one of the stakes about 8-inches high. After that, you can weave the twine in-and-out of the plants then wrap it around the other stake before returning to weave the other side to tie off your twice, which should be fairly taut. This alternating weaving pattern will ensure that your tomatoes stay supported in all sorts of inclement weather. Just add more twine with every six inches of growth, keeping the plants supported. Once the season’s over, your system can even be recycled, if you’re extra careful about removing the twine and your stakes won’t interfere with your other projects.

      "page_content='5 SOIL COLLECTION Depending on your extension agency, you might be able to collect the soil yourself and send it in. If you take this route, the best time to test is in October or November, leaving you time to make adjustments and plan for your spring garden. To collect the soil, you’ll need a trowel (or some other digging tool) and a bucket. You should dig out a hunk of soil about six inches deep. That hunk doesn’t really matter, so dump it somewhere. Now you’ll need to collect a profile slice of the dirt and toss it in the bucket. (This allows you to capture a picture of the whole root zone.) Repeat this process six more times throughout your garden and then mix all of those samples in your bucket. Finally, you can bag this concoction and ship it off for analysis. All you’ve got left to do is await the results and apply the recommended amendments. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS The results of your test will let you know what plants will naturally thrive in your garden, but that won’t be much of a hurdle with the right amendments. Other factors to consider when choosing the plants for your garden include: Seasonal Sensitivity - Some crops will thrive in the summer, while others can tolerate a little frost. (Other crops are perennials, which means you can plant them just once and harvest them yearly, or biennials, which take two years to grow.) Warm-season crops, which need high temperatures to make fruit, include corn, cucumbers, melons, peppers, snap beans, squash, and tomatoes' metadata={'page': 5, 'source': './docs/Technical-Gardening-Manual-FINAL.pdf'}\n",
      "page_content='8 zucchini. The take-away here is that you want to make sure that during your next growing season, each piece of soil is occupied by a new family, even if pests and diseases did no damage in the previous season. Final Considerations: *Make sure your plot is level and well-drained. You could try to observe it before you plant and see how swampy it gets during rainy weather. Avoid planting in those spots if possible. *Another observation strategy is to look where the weeds are most sturdy and rich. This area will also be conducive to the thriving of your plants. *Always keep something in the ground! This is called succession planting and requires that you understand the maturation dates of your plants so that you know when you’ll be planting new crops. For more information on the maturation dates your plants, contact your extension agency!' metadata={'page': 8, 'source': './docs/Technical-Gardening-Manual-FINAL.pdf'}\n"

      "32 Tomatoes... It’s difficult to imagine a complete garden without them. And in the kitchen, they’re a favorite--a rich, versatile vegetable that is equally at home in nutritious salad or on a satisfying burger. And yet when you’re growing them, tomatoes can often be problematic. Their culinary versatility also translate into their growing habits as well, as they show a willingness to grow however they please, seeming to defy both gravity and the nearness of your garden plot. Biologically, your tomato plants want to mature and spread their seeds, dropping the tomatoes to the earth, so gardeners often seek out ways to elevate their tomatoes. Other reasons to support your tomatoes include: • Your tomatoes are less prone to insect and disease damage. If you choose to support your tomatoes, then you’ve got another problem: What option to do you choose? Do you follow in the footsteps of your grandfather and create a cage for your tomatoes? Do you stake them? • Your tomatoes stay dirt-free. • Your tomatoes are easier to monitor and harvest. the florida weave\n",

      "3 Gardening is easy, right? All you do is measure some rows, till the earth, and plant your seeds. From there, your garden will grow on its while you sit back and relax... Right? Wrong. Like all worthwhile pursuits, gardening requires devotion and routine maintenance. Your heirloom tomatoes can indeed blossom from A all the way to Z, but they will need your help getting there, as you water and perhaps trellis them along their path to ripeness. Yes, the seeds you’ve sown today will need attention tomorrow.... And the tomorrow after that, all the way to harvest time. And before we can consider tomorrow’s work, we have to consider yesterday’s. PLANTING CONSIDERATIONS PREVENTATIVE MEASURES Often, the best way to solve a problem is by ensuring that it never happens. Of course, an incredible cook can salvage a cooking fiasco without the perfect ingredients or tools, but just imagine how much tastier the dish would be if all the right pieces had been in the kitchen all along. The same applies to gardening, where the earth is your kitchen. Here’s what you can do in the early stages of gardening to ensure that you don’t end up with a fiasco months down the road.\n",

      "33 While none of your options are necessarily bad and everything has its place, based on the particulars of your operation, we at Grow Appalachia recommend the Florida Weave method of tomato trellising. This method appeals to growers because it’s inexpensive and it works. HOW IT WORKS One thing that you need to keep in mind is that you want to do the trellising process pretty early on, before your plants are more than a couple of feet tall. If you try the Florida Weave method later than this, you run the risk of stalking your roots and traumatizing your plants, and it will be difficult to work around the tangled vegetation. You’ll begin by taking stakes around 8 feet tall and driving them a foot into the ground between every few plants. Next, you will want to take some twine, preferably something that’s not too elastic, and tie it to one of the stakes about 8-inches high. After that, you can weave the twine in-and-out of the plants then wrap it around the other stake before returning to weave the other side to tie off your twice, which should be fairly taut. This alternating weaving pattern will ensure that your tomatoes stay supported in all sorts of inclement weather. Just add more twine with every six inches of growth, keeping the plants supported. Once the season’s over, your system can even be recycled, if you’re extra careful about removing the twine and your stakes won’t interfere with your other projects.

      "5 SOIL COLLECTION Depending on your extension agency, you might be able to collect the soil yourself and send it in. If you take this route, the best time to test is in October or November, leaving you time to make adjustments and plan for your spring garden. To collect the soil, you’ll need a trowel (or some other digging tool) and a bucket. You should dig out a hunk of soil about six inches deep. That hunk doesn’t really matter, so dump it somewhere. Now you’ll need to collect a profile slice of the dirt and toss it in the bucket. (This allows you to capture a picture of the whole root zone.) Repeat this process six more times throughout your garden and then mix all of those samples in your bucket. Finally, you can bag this concoction and ship it off for analysis. All you’ve got left to do is await the results and apply the recommended amendments. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS The results of your test will let you know what plants will naturally thrive in your garden, but that won’t be much of a hurdle with the right amendments. Other factors to consider when choosing the plants for your garden include: Seasonal Sensitivity - Some crops will thrive in the summer, while others can tolerate a little frost. (Other crops are perennials, which means you can plant them just once and harvest them yearly, or biennials, which take two years to grow.) Warm-season crops, which need high temperatures to make fruit, include corn, cucumbers, melons, peppers, snap beans, squash, and tomatoes\n",

      "7 Garden Planning - You will want to be certain that the layout of your garden makes sense based on your plants and locations, and this is a process that should be done on paper. (Of course, there is computer software out there, for those who are more technologically inclined!) Make sure that you understand what your different plants will look like once they fully mature. Otherwise, you might end up with a garden that is too sparse or too cluttered, both of which can be tough to maintain. And neither will be particularly pleasing to the eye. You might think that this is a technique that pros will eventually outgrow, but this is actually what pros will do from year-to-year, collecting data on how well each crop grew in its particular location and using it to make smart moves in the future. Crop Rotation- Crop rotation is a part of garden planning. It is a technique for minimizing future pest and disease issues. Essentially, your plants can be divided into types or families, and pests, bacteria, and fungi, which all can live in the soil season after season, usually gravitate towards particular families. If you rotate through planting different crop families in the same spot, however, you will remove the food source for these pests and diseases. For the sake of simplicity, we will focus on three families: brassacus, solanaceous, and cucurbits. Brassacus includes things like cabbage, kale, and mustard, and these plants share pests like flea beetles, harlequin bugs, and stink bugs\n",
